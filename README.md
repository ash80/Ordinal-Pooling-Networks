# Ordinal Pooling Networks

This repository contains the sample code for the implementation of Ordinal Pooling Networks (OPNs). For more details on this scheme, please refer to Ordinal Pooling Networks paper on [arXiv](<link>).

### Description of the files

This repository contains the following 3 files

* **CNN_Model.jpg** - Architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks based model to classify the digits in MNIST database.
* **Max_Pooling_NN.py** - An implementation of the CNN model, where pooling is performed using max-pooling operation.
* **Ordinal_Pooling_NN.py** - An implementation of the CNN model, where pooling is performed using the proposed OPNs.
